# NFT Fintech

FinancierasNFT is a web based application that uses Web3 technology to authenticate to the app and make real state operations. 

This is a fork of the original project which can be found [here](https://github.com/sebapch/FinancierasNFT)


* Worked in the `auth` branch
* Reworked the entire achitecture to start from scratch
* Implemented several funcionalities in some branches that are currently ahead of this repo (check original repo for further info) mostly authentication related
